# CNN Task for Project Members:

**1. Convolution Neural Networks are a core class of Neural Networks that are often operated on visual imagery. CNN architectures are commonly used for [Image Classification](https://www.thinkautomation.com/eli5/eli5-what-is-image-classification-in-deep-learning/), implement ResNet18 from scratch. Make your submission using the following steps:**
- Fork and clone this Github repository.
- Create a new branch and set its name to your “Name”.
- Create a folder named "Name" (or Handle) in which you have all the contents of whatever submission you wanna make.
- Merge your branch with the master branch.
- Pull origin & add files, commit and push to fork.
- Create pull request on main repo.

Brownie Points for implementing any ResNet (takes block and layers)

**2. Hint**: You have to implement the torch.nn.module class for the models.

**3. Tip**: Look at the resources attached, and try exploring more articles/papers to develop a deeper understanding.
