# CNN Task for Project Members:

**Convolution Neural Networks are a core class of Neural Networks that are often operated on visual imagery. CNN architectures are commonly used for [Image Classification](https://www.thinkautomation.com/eli5/eli5-what-is-image-classification-in-deep-learning/), implement ResNet18 from scratch.** 

Brownie Points for implementing any ResNet (takes block and layers)

**Hint**: You have to implement the torch.nn.module class for the models.

**Tip**: Look at the resources attached, and try exploring more articles/papers to develop a deeper understanding.
