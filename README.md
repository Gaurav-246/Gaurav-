# CNN Task for Project Members:

**Convolution Neural Networks are a core class of Neural Networks that are often operated on visual imagery. Implement, from scratch, CNN architectures commonly used for [Image Classification](https://www.thinkautomation.com/eli5/eli5-what-is-image-classification-in-deep-learning/), namely, [VGG19](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/image-detection-using-convolutional-neural-networks-89c9e21fffa3), [LeNet](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-and-implementing-lenet-5-cnn-architecture-deep-learning-a2d531ebc342), [AlexNet](https://towardsdatascience.com/alexnet-the-architecture-that-challenged-cnns-e406d5297951), etc., using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to classify the images of the [CIFAR10](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NUVkwsHYahjS7tHD3W_cbxk6EeRycnnl/view?usp=sharing) dataset.**

Hint: You have to implement the torch.nn.module class for the models.

Tip: Read the articles attached, and try exploring more articles/papers to develop a deeper understanding. 

**Caution: Do not copy pre-existing implementations blindly.**
